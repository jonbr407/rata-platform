# Rātā: Real-Time Geospatial Field Operations Software

*(Proven in pest control. Built for scale.)*

Rātā is a real-time data capture and coordination platform originally developed for the pest control industry in Aotearoa. Built by field operators, for field operators — it replaces fragmented workflows with a seamless system that combines mobile data collection, live mapping, and centralised oversight.

It begins in pest control — but the underlying system is designed to support any remote, compliance-heavy field operation.

## 🚀 Why Rātā?

New Zealand’s innovation efforts often focus on our major industries — but there’s a high-impact opportunity hiding in plain sight.

Pest control is **underrepresented in the private tech and startup ecosystem on the global stage**, and **New Zealand is a global leader in pest management research and ecological restoration**.

With **Rātā**, we have an opportunity to harness Kiwi ingenuity and build scalable, AI-driven pest control solutions — tools that can serve not just Aotearoa, but be exported to meet global environmental and biosecurity challenges.

## 🧱 What Rātā Does

- 📱 **Snapchat-style field app** (offline-first, photo-based, GPS-tagged)
- 🗺️ **Live map dashboard** (Google Earth-style team tracking & trap visibility)
- 💾 **Seamless sync & export** (clean CSV, GPX, structured media logs)
- 🔒 **Built-in privacy tools** (landowner visibility limits, contractor protections)
- 🤖 **AI-ready data architecture** (structured from day one for automation)
