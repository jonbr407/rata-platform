# Roadmap

## 🧭 **Rātā: From Draft Docs to Funded MVP**

**Master Roadmap & Timeline Structure**

(*Final version to live in Notion and GitHub*)

---

### ✅ **Stage 0: Consolidate and Finalise Documentation**

**Goal**: Align all written material with current ideas. Get your foundational documents airtight.

**Tasks**:

- [ ]  Review and update all five GitHub docs with recent developments
- [ ]  Cross-check for overlaps, contradictions, or missing logic
- [ ]  Make each one *funding-ready*: structured, polished, with clear intent

**Output**:

Updated versions of:

- Project Proposal
- MVP Specification
- Technical Breakdown
- Problem Statement
- Strategy & Timeline

---

### 🧱 **Stage 1: Build the Case for Funding**

**Goal**: Make a pack to show funders, incubators, or advisors that this isn’t an idea—it’s a business.

**Tasks**:

- [ ]  Create a README-style doc summarising Rātā at a glance
- [ ]  Add a “Pitch Pack” folder:
    - Executive Summary (1-pager)
    - Vision and Opportunity
    - MVP Funding Ask (budget & timeline)
    - Use Case Examples (OSPRI, DOC, private contractors)
- [ ]  Build the “Why Now” urgency doc (funding bait)
- [ ]  Add letters of support (even informal ones)
- [ ]  Start identifying possible NZ incubators, funds, or competitions

---

### 🧠 **Stage 2: Seek Early Advice / Industry Buy-In**

**Goal**: Talk to smart people before talking to rich people.

**Tasks**:

- [ ]  Identify 3–5 key mentors/advisors you trust (tech/dev/GIS/startup)
- [ ]  Send them a curated document pack
- [ ]  Ask for feedback specifically on:
    - MVP viability
    - Budget realism
    - Technical risk
- [ ]  Capture feedback in a “Mentor Notes” doc
- [ ]  Adjust documentation if needed

---

### 💰 **Stage 3: Begin MVP Fundraising**

**Goal**: Get $150K–$250K lined up for the MVP.

**Tasks**:

- [ ]  Choose fundraising path:
    - ☐ Public grants (e.g., Callaghan, DOC)
    - ☐ Angel investors
    - ☐ Private partnerships (e.g., Rentokil, OSPRI-style co-build)
- [ ]  Customise pitch material per funding type
- [ ]  Start contacting and submitting applications
- [ ]  Use traction (mentor endorsements, early adopters) as leverage

---

### 🚀 **Stage 4: MVP Team & Development Begins**

**Goal**: Translate the documents into code.

**Tasks**:

- [ ]  Confirm dev lead (e.g., Sudhir)
- [ ]  Set up remote dev tools (Notion, GitHub Projects, Figma etc.)
- [ ]  Lock in 2–3 extra hires (frontend, backend, GIS)
- [ ]  Build the alpha in sprints:
    - ☐ Mobile app base
    - ☐ Topo map integration
    - ☐ Dashboard wireframe
- [ ]  Run internal test with High Country fieldwork
- [ ]  Use real-time feedback to iterate
