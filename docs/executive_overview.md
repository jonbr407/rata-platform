### ✍️ Current Draft:

Rātā is a data capture and operations platform built for New Zealand’s pest control industry — not because that’s where it ends, but because that’s the perfect place to prove what it’s capable of.

Rātā streamlines rural fieldwork by combining a photo-based mobile app with a live mapping and task dashboard. Field operators collect visual data directly from the bush using a lightweight app built to work offline. That data is then automatically timestamped, geotagged, and displayed on a central map interface at base. This gives managers, contractors, team leaders, and clients a live view of progress — from trap locations to completed tasks — all in one shared map interface.

The platform is being built by people who understand the field — with deep knowledge of the real workflows, pain points, and productivity issues faced by pest control contractors across Aotearoa. Unlike generic task apps or government portals, Rātā is built for the way pest control actually works in the wild. It prioritises image-first data, offline sync, fast UX, and preset data tags to help field operators quickly and efficiently gather valuable data that fuels new tools and services — including future offerings on Rātās own marketplace.

While the MVP targets pest control, the platform is designed to scale. Any industry with field-based work — including environmental research, exploration, or rural asset management — can use Rātā to capture clean data and manage it through our unified dashboard. Future plans include Rātā Lite for small operators and subscription-based advanced tiers like Rātā Pro and Rātā Pest, which will offer AI-assisted task automation, smart trap integrations, and deep reporting.

In a world of growing uncertainty where ecosystems are becoming more unstable, one thing remains constant — the need for better coordination and smarter management systems to help humans scale land operations as efficiently as possible. Every productivity gain here matters.

### ✍️ Previous Draft:

### 🔖 Core Idea

- Rātā is a **data capture and management platform** built for New Zealand’s pest control industry.
- It combines a mobile app, real-time mapping, and a command interface to centralize fieldwork data and reduce manual admin.
- Designed for offline fieldwork, live tracking, and future integrations like AI and trap telemetry.

**Your Edits:**

- [ ]  Rātā is intended as a **data capture and management platform** built for New Zealand’s pest control industry, although it will likely see use as a generalised field data collection and management tool for other industries who share a similar work flow to rural pest operations. Field research and exploration focused companies will also be able to use this platform to manage their workflows.
- It combines a mobile data collection and mapping app with a desktop ‘field view’ interface to centralize fieldwork data and reduce manual admin currently associated with pest operation workflows. Things like automated client reporting and visualisation, task assignment, job estimation calculations and field worker performance enhancing are all possible with the Rātā platform. Its long run aim is to increase the productivity of field operations by learning from pest control work contractors data and building a more efficient system.
- Rātās core value proposition is its ability to force its field users to capture and annotate images as part of their daily routines. A large part of the value proposition for Rata is its ability to capture and store clean data to use for decision making and task automation.
- Designed from the outset by a field worker to be future proofed for the challenges of remote rural pest control operations and an ever increasing technological future. Core features the platform is designed around are offline fieldwork, live tracking, and futureproofing the platform for integrations like AI computer vision models and trap telemetry.
- Designed with future hardware and always online capabilities in mind, but optimised for current gen hardware and offline data collection, Rātā aims for ease of adoption in mind at the MVP stage but scalability in mind for the future. As Rātā matures, these original features designed around current technology limits will become the basis for a Rātā Lite version while the features developed from the data collected on the platform will influence the direction of paid tiers, Rātā Pro and Rātā Pest etc.

### 🔖 Pain Point

- Pest control operations are using **fragmented, outdated systems**.
- Field data is often siloed, lost, or poorly formatted.
- There’s **no shared platform** across field workers, managers, and clients — this leads to inconsistent delivery, higher costs, and loss of confidence.

**Your Edits:**

- [ ]  Pest control operations are using fragmented outdated systems. These systems can be costly for companies and moves more resources out of the field and into the office which limits scalability.
- [ ]  There is often mistakes made from the current data capture tools and human error in using them that require time from specialised IT team members to be able to fix the errors.
- [ ]  Current data capture tools frequently have errors that cannot be fixed without specialised knowledge.
- [ ]  Current data capture tools aren’t always optimised to be as efficient as possible for field operators, they often impact work flows and sense of rhythm in the field.
- [ ]  There is no unified shared system that easily lets all stake holders, from funders to land owners and contractors, a view to see how the operations are progressing.
- [ ]  There is no unified task management tool created for pest control operations to assign tasks or track gear in the field. Tasks are all still assigned manually and inventories are catalogued in a way where human error leads to inaccurate management of resources.
- [ ]  There is no tool for outdoor pest operations to visually locate team mates on a map. In the field, all coordination is done with auditory instructions over radio or mobile, leading to less than efficient coordination at times.

### 🔖 How Rātā Fixes It

- Operators use a **Snapchat-style mobile app** to collect images and task data in the field.
- Data is **automatically tagged with time, GPS, and task type**.
- A web-based command UI shows **live maps, task progress, trap locations, and photo logs**.
- The system is **built for integration**: barcode scanners, smart traps, AI insights, drone footage, external reporting systems.
- It gives every layer of the pest control chain a **shared, accurate operational view**.

**Your Edits:**

- [ ]  …Humans are predominantly rely on their vision, we are able to digest information easier when visualised. Operators use a snapchat style mobile app to collect images and task data in the field, navigate and relay information to other team members.
- [ ]  Data is automatically tagged with time GPS and task type if pre set task enabled.
- [ ]  App is designed to minimise clicks as much as possible for field operator gathering data, and operate on the principle of can a field operator complete all steps of a task with only one hand if possible?
- [ ]  The snapchat field data app relays all its data a central command screen back at base, where the data will be overlaid on a 3D field map of the worksite. Similar to google earth, the command screen will have similar features and add overlays to show traps, ferratox bag placement and any other data you wish to capture.
- [ ]  The system will be built for security, but will feature a method to be able to connect smart devices to the network, allowing field operators and central command to be able to view their devices status from the application, similar to how devices might connect to a smart home system.  Barcode scanners, smart traps, AI insights, drone footage, external reporting systems are all intended features in future development stages.
- [ ]  it gives every layer of the operational control chain a **shared, accurate operational view**.
- [ ]  It futureproofs for a time when intelligence gathering through thermal camera, drone and ai based pest detection technology becomes more mature by building a system based around image based classification models as a core business strategy post MVP.
