# Problem Statement

## 🔖 Assignment Note – Problem Statement

**🧭 Purpose:**

Clearly describe the real-world problem(s) that Rātā addresses.

---

### 💡 Focus Points:

- What problems are operators, companies, or landowners currently facing?
- Where do current tools fall short? (Be specific)
- What are the consequences if this doesn’t get fixed?
- Why is this problem important now?

---

### ✅ Writing Checklist:

- [x]  Based in field reality (quote examples if possible)
- [x]  Covers multiple pain points across the pest control chain
- [x]  Includes urgency / cost / scale issues
- [x]  Reader finishes thinking “yep, that sucks — fix it”
- [x]  Ready to sync with GitHub → `problem.md`

# 🧩 Problem Statement – Rātā

---

### **The tools exist—but the system doesn’t.**

New Zealand’s pest control operations are full of intelligent tools—GPS systems, mobile apps, data tags, GIS overlays—but they don’t work together. There’s no single, unified system to capture data, coordinate teams, enforce quality, and report progress across the entire operation. In most industries, generic tools and fragmented systems can be tolerated—the cost of inefficiency is often outweighed by the savings of not building something bespoke. But in outdoor fieldwork—where teams are remote, gear-dependent, and operational windows are tight—every inefficiency compounds. Unified systems aren’t just nice to have; they’re critical to keeping costs down, quality up, and people aligned across large, remote worksites.

---

### **Verification is manual, expensive, and inconsistent.**

Client stakeholders, landowners, and contractors all need proof that work has been done to standard. But verifying work today relies heavily on trust or infrequent quality checks; as the systems used in the field weren’t designed to enforce quality at the point of capture.

Consistency varies from operator to operator, team to team. Without integrated visual records tied to time and location, it’s nearly impossible to ensure standards are being met across large-scale pest operations without a heavy administrative load.

---

### **Legacy systems slow down modern operations.**

Tools like Avenza, Trap.NZ, Vector Tracks, and Fieldmaps were great for earlier stages of the industry—and while they’re still in use, they fall short in key ways. They weren’t built to scale with automation, lack integration, and can’t keep up with modern data needs.

They create friction where there should be flow: switching between disconnected apps, losing visibility when offline, often slow or buggy, and poor design make it easy to make data input errors.

---

### **Critical coordination tasks aren’t centralised.**

Managing contractor certifications, hazard briefings, vehicle tracking, and fieldwork compliance often requires multiple disconnected systems—or worse, manual oversight. This decentralised approach not only wastes time but also increases the risk of non-compliance, missed tasks, and poor-quality data.

High-standard contracts like those from OSPRI already demand all of this—and more. But there's no single tool that brings it together.

---

### **Slow feedback loops increase cost and risk.**

Without real-time oversight, problems go unnoticed until it’s too late to fix them efficiently. Field teams can’t see what others are doing. Managers can’t spot gaps in progress or respond dynamically to field events, and often struggle to forecast job timeframes consistently. Clients and landowners only get fragmented summaries after the fact—often based on inconsistent data and limited quality verification.

This leads to budget blowouts, inefficiencies in redeployment, and lost confidence from stakeholders who can’t clearly see what’s being delivered on the ground when inspections get failed due to workload pressure and rushed jobs.

---

### **The result? Projects take longer, cost more, and deliver less.**

Lack of integration leads to wasted time. Lack of visibility leads to missed opportunities. Lack of automation leads to avoidable admin and overhead and poor work time allocation.

For any contractor, organisation, or funder trying to operate at scale, these inefficiencies add up to real dollars lost—and opportunities left on the table.

---

### **Why now?**

Hardware and software capabilities have caught up: mobile connectivity, smart traps, geospatial mapping, and AI analysis are more available and affordable than ever before.

What hasn’t emerged is the system to bring it all together.

Rātā exists to fill that gap. It futureproofs pest control operations by aligning daily fieldwork with structured, verifiable data capture—laying the foundation for automation, quality assurance, and scalable project delivery.

The tools are ready. The work is happening. **Rātā is the platform to bring it all into one place—and finally make it work together.**

### **The tools exist—but the system doesn’t.**

New Zealand’s pest control operations are full of intelligent tools—GPS systems, mobile apps, data tags, GIS overlays—but they don’t work together. There’s no single, unified system to capture data, coordinate teams, enforce quality, and report progress across the entire operation. That lack of integration creates delays, weakens verification, and drives up project costs—especially at scale.

---

### **Verification is manual, expensive, and inconsistent.**

Client stakeholders, landowners, and contractors all need proof that work has been done to standard. But verifying work today relies heavily on trust, backtracking, or supervisor rechecks—because the systems used in the field weren’t designed to enforce quality at the point of capture.

Consistency varies from operator to operator, team to team. Without integrated visual records tied to time and location, it’s nearly impossible to ensure standards are being met across large-scale pest operations without a heavy administrative load.

### **Legacy systems slow down modern operations.**

Tools like Avenza, Trap.NZ, VectorTrak, and Wall-IS were built for earlier stages of the industry—and while they’re still in use, they fall short in key ways. They weren’t built to scale with automation, don’t enforce consistent workflows, and can’t keep up with modern data needs.

They create friction where there should be flow: switching between disconnected apps, losing visibility when offline, or duplicating entry to meet reporting requirements.
