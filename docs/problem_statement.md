### ✍️ Current Draft:

### **Rātā brings everything into one place.**

Instead of juggling separate apps like Trap.NZ, Avenza, spreadsheets, radios, and messaging tools, Rātā unifies data capture, mapping, and team coordination into a single platform. Operators use a simple mobile app to log traps, take photos, and enter details on-site—no coverage needed. Data syncs automatically when a connection is available.

This reduces manual handling, avoids duplication, and ensures every job has accurate, timestamped, and geotagged records from the field.

---

### **It turns the bush into a live, shareable map.**

Every trap, trackfile, photo, and team member appears in real time on a centralised dashboard—modelled after the look and feel of Google Earth. Managers can see job progress as it unfolds, identify potential problems early, and plan ahead without relying on second-hand updates.

Clients and landowners can log in to track work on their land and download reports. Everyone sees the same thing, updated in real time.

---

### **It’s built for how pest control actually works.**

Designed from scratch for the field conditions of Aotearoa, Rātā works offline, runs on standard laptops and tablets, and is designed to be picked up with little training. It’s been modelled on the best bits from current field products in use today to be optimised for Field Operators collecting OSPRI data. It’s fast, responsive, and suited to rugged environments where cell signal is unreliable and time is limited.

Instead of adapting generic software, this system is shaped around real workflows—built by those who’ve worked on the ground.

---

### **Ready to scale and grow smarter over time.**

While the MVP focuses on clean data capture and central coordination, Rātā is built with long-term value in mind. The platform is designed to integrate with future AI tools—for tasks like automatic species recognition, predictive mapping, and work quality scoring—without needing to rebuild the system from scratch.

It’s not just solving problems now. It’s creating the infrastructure to do better work tomorrow.

### ✍️ First Draft:

### **Disjointed tools decrease field productivity.**

Operators juggle multiple data collection apps, multiple communication methods; data corruption errors and manual data transfers are commonplace. There’s no centralised system to harness the full capability of the tools currently employed in the field. When things go wrong, valuable time is lost trying to communicate location and information to coordinate.

---

### **There’s no way to visualise the field in real time.**

Providing progress updates to stakeholders and monitoring for quality control are time-consuming tasks that disrupt other work that might more directly increase productivity and reduce time on the job.

Everyone from the field operator to the landowners and managers on larger-scale worksites can’t be aware of everything happening on-site at once—you’re often left wondering what’s *actually* going on.

---

### **Field coordination is stuck in the past.**

Teams rely heavily on verbal communication in an environment where constant signal isn’t guaranteed. Try getting your new teammate to relay their position with patchy reception at 5pm for pickup—it can turn into a slow, frustrating process. Verbal communication is a less efficient way to describe location than live positioning.

---

### **Reporting is slow, manual, and riddled with errors.**

After long days in the field, entering data becomes a chore—and accuracy suffers. It makes cost tracking inaccurate, can disrupt the ordering of critical supplies, and leads to less informed decisions on redeployment or survey needs.

---

### **No real-time visibility = missed opportunities.**

Companies and clients can’t visualise data in the field like trap locations instantly—there’s a delay that means decision-making is always behind. Contractors can’t be 100% sure of their field operators’ standard of work because it’s too costly to enforce quality control all the time.

Funding providers are in the same boat—they’re expected to invest without being able to verify the standard of execution. Landowners only get fragments of information like kill counts or heatmaps, because anything more detailed takes too long to put together.

---

### **Tech exists, but not for us.**

Tools like Avenza, Trap.NZ, Vector Tracks, and Wall-IS aren’t built with modern frontline data collection in mind—they aren’t prepared for an AI and task automation future.

They’re clunky, slow, not properly field-tested, and suffer from design flaws that actively reduce efficiency in the field.

---

### **The consequence? Projects that take longer, cost more, and dispatch fewer pests.**

Poor coordination, weak data systems and a lack of simple cost tracking automation can lead to missed opportunities, wasted hours, and delays in resupply. That’s not just inefficient—it’s costly, posing a serious operational risk to any organisation trying to scale. 

---

### **Why now?**

Core technologies like thermal cameras, drone automation, mobile connectivity, and AI-based analysis have reached a tipping point—they’re now affordable and reliable enough to be deployed in real-world outdoor environments. But the pest control industry lacks a system designed to coordinate and scale these tools across field operations.

Right now, innovators and contractors are building smart tools in isolation, with no shared platform to deploy, monitor, or manage them in the field. Project managers are stuck using outdated apps and manual coordination—slowing down adoption and making it harder to extract value from emerging tech.

AI is especially promising for automating tasks like trap analysis, pest ID, and progress tracking. But without a platform to act as its foundation, that potential stays theoretical.

Rātā bridges that gap—bringing proven technology together under one operational system designed for real-world pest management. The tech is ready. What’s missing is the infrastructure to use it at scale.

### ✍️ First Draft:

- **Disjointed field tools make pest control harder, not easier.**
    
    Operators juggle radios, spreadsheets, phones, and half-baked apps just to log a trap.
    
    When things go wrong, it's a mess of miscommunication, lost data, or someone getting lost in the bush.
    
    ✏️ **Your Edit:**
    
    - Disconnected tools decrease field productivity. Operators juggle multiple data collection apps, multiple communication methods; data corruption errors and manual data transfers are commonplace. There is no centralised system to harness the full capability of the tools currently employed in the field. When things go wrong, valuable time is lost communicating location and information to be able to coordinate.

- **Field coordination is stuck in the past.**
    
    Teams rely on verbal descriptions and radio directions to guide others through unfamiliar terrain.
    
    If you’ve ever tried describing a ridgeline over the radio in a storm, you know how dumb that is.
    
    ✏️ **Your Edit:**
    
    Teams rely heavily on verbal communication in an environment where constant communication ability isn’t always guaranteed - try get your new team mate to relay their position in patchy signal at the end of a day for pickup can be a slow process. Verbal communication is a less efficient to describe your location than live location.

- **Reporting is slow, manual, and riddled with errors.**
    
    After long days in the field, data entry becomes a chore — and the accuracy suffers.
    
    Delays in reporting affect decisions on resupply, resurvey, or redeployment.
    
    ✏️ **Your Edit:** 
    
    After long days in the field, data entry becomes a chore — and the accuracy of cost tracking suffers as quantities and time spent on the block are usually estimated. 
    
    Delays in reporting affect decisions on resupply.
    
    Not visualising data in real time can lead to misinterpretations of data trends and mean critical decisions are being made less informed.

- **No real-time visibility = missed opportunities.**
    
    Companies and clients can’t see trap effectiveness or hotspot trends until it’s too late.
    
    Contractors can't prove their value, and landowners can’t see impact for their money.
    
    ✏️ **Your Edit:**
    
    Companies and clients can’t visualise data in the field like traps instantly, there is a delayed effect, meaning a delay in decision making capabilities.
    
    Contractors can’t be 100% sure of their field operators standard of work currently as it is too costly to enforce quality control all the time.
    
    Funding providers can’t be 100% sure of their contractors standard of work currently as it is too costly to enforce quality control all the time
    
    Landowners only get communicated small bits of information such as kill counts and heat maps, as it is time consuming to provide comprehensive reporting

---

- **Why now? Because the window is closing.**
    
    With Predator Free 2050 as a national goal, the pressure is on to scale effective, auditable pest control systems fast.
    
    Innovation must keep pace with field demands, or we risk falling behind — again.
    
    ✏️ **Your Edit:**
    
    Because the tools required to do the bulk of the future innovation tasks to make industries like pest control more efficient, cheaper and easier to access than ever. Tech such as Ai, thermal camera technology, full mobile connectivity and drone technology and flight automation are maturing rapidly.
    
    Innovators need a platform to host their solutions to outdoor projects such as pest control
