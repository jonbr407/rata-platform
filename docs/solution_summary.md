### ✅ **Solution Summary – Rātā**

- **At its core**, Rātā is a real-time field operations and data management platform built specifically for pest control—merging a mobile data capture app with a centralised live mapping dashboard.
    
    Edit: At its core, Rātā is a real-time field operations and data management platform built with pest control productivity in mind, but it is capable of so much more.

- **Mobile-first simplicity**: Operators use a lightweight, offline-ready mobile app to capture photos, log trap data, and tag location—all with minimal taps. The UI is inspired by Snapchat’s speed and familiarity, reducing training time.

- **Central mapping intelligence**: All field data syncs to a game-engine-driven dashboard that looks and feels like Google Earth —giving central command instant visibility over traps, teams, and hotspots and the ability to plan forward and send instructions to the team.
