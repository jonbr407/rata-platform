## Strategy & Timeline for Rātā Platform

### 🎯 **Purpose:**

Outline a structured, milestone-based roadmap for developing, validating, and scaling Rātā from an MVP to a widely adopted pest management platform.

---

### 🚦 **Main Phases of Development**

### **Phase 1: Research & Specification (Months 1–2)**

- Finalise MVP requirements based on frontline feedback.
- Engage GIS and software development experts.
- Define software architecture clearly for mobile app, mapping, and backend.
- **Mentor Checkpoint:** End of Month 2, consult with trusted industry mentors or advisors for strategic feedback and validation of the initial approach.

### **Phase 2: Prototype Build (Months 3–4)**

- Develop a minimal working mobile application and static dashboard.
- Incorporate GPS-based photo capture and offline capability.
- Conduct internal testing with actual field data.

### **Phase 3: Field Trials (Months 5–6)**

- Deploy the prototype in a live pest control operation.
- Capture detailed user feedback on usability, responsiveness, and gaps.

### **Phase 4: Iteration & Feature Expansion (Months 7–8)**

- Refine MVP based on trial feedback.
- Introduce real-time team tracking and integrated map layers.
- Begin basic imagery analysis for pest hotspots.

### **Phase 5: Pre-Launch Testing & Optimisation (Months 9–10)**

- Conduct comprehensive testing across varied hardware and connectivity conditions.
- Optimise platform speed, battery efficiency, and offline functionality.

### **Phase 6: MVP Release & Early Adoption (Month 10 onwards)**

- Official launch of fully functional MVP to select early adopters.
- Structured onboarding, continuous feedback, and iterative improvements.

---

### 📈 **Funding & Growth Strategy**

### Initial MVP Development Funding

- Target initial funding of **$150,000–$250,000 NZD** to cover development, testing hardware, GIS/UI expertise, and pilot implementation.

### Follow-up Funding & Scale-up

- Leverage successful pilot data to pursue additional public/private co-funding.
- Structured funding stages tied to clear metrics and proven success in initial deployments.

### Strategic Partnerships

- Engage partnerships with existing pest control agencies (DOC, regional councils, private contractors, OSPRI).
- Foster collaboration with tech providers to accelerate advanced features (AI, computer vision integration).
- Foster collaboration with smart tech and trap innovators to provide automated data display for
- Rātā dashboard.

---

### 🔄 **Transitioning from Tool → Platform**

### Step 1: Validation & Adoption

- Confirm MVP viability through tangible field results and stakeholder endorsement.

### Step 2: Incremental Feature Integration

- Gradually incorporate AI-driven features (pest identification, predictive analytics, automatic work verification).
- Introduce third-party device integrations (smart traps, sensors, cameras).

### Step 3: Marketplace & Ecosystem

- Establish Rātā as an open ecosystem with secure APIs for external integrations.
- Develop a marketplace for third-party vendors to offer compatible devices, tools, and analytical models.

### Step 4: Scalability & Global Expansion

- Ensure platform architecture is modular and scalable.
- Prepare Rātā for international markets by adapting to global pest management needs and standards.

---

### 🚩 **Future Goals & Vision**

- Become the standard operational platform for all types of pest management operations in New Zealand.
- Expand internationally by positioning Rātā as a global leader in data-driven pest control solutions.
- Introduce a consumer version of Rātā designed for all remote data collection tasks.
- Continuously innovate by leveraging cutting-edge technology and partnerships, maintaining market relevance and scalability.

This structured approach ensures that Rātā is robustly developed, strategically validated, and primed for sustainable growth and broad market adoption.
