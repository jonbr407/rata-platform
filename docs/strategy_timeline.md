### 🧭 **Technical Pathway During Phase 1**

- Potential tech advisors surfaced in Mentor Review 2
- Tech stack finalised based on vision, budget, scalability
- Developer documentation built in parallel with decision-making
- Cost estimates become clearer with each technical step
- Architecture feasibility compared to vision

---

### 👥 **Tech Mentor Review 1 – Mid-Phase Check**

> Occurs during system architecture planning
> 
- Helps guide stack selection, dev plan, and implementation strategy
- Helps catch red flags early

---

### 👥 **Tech Mentor Review 2 – Late-Phase Check**

> Occurs during system architecture planning finalisation
> 
- Validates final stack selection, dev plan, and implementation strategy
- Helps ensure the vision is aligning with the tech

---

### 📦 **Documents**

> This is where everything converges.
> 

All document categories—core, investor, and technical—are finalised using the most up-to-date strategic and architectural information. The technical documentation now directly informs and reinforces the content in the MVP spec, budget proposals, and pitch deck.

At this stage:

- Tech feasibility supports the business case
- MVP specification reflects validated scope
- Budget and timelines are grounded in technical input
- All claims made to funders are backed by evidence, design, or validated planning

**Everything is now under scrutiny—from both business mentors and technical advisors.**

---

### 👥 **Mentor Review 3 + Tech Mentor Review 3 – Final Gate**

> Occurs at end of Phase 1
> 

The **make or break moment** for Rātā’s future

- Full review by business mentors + technical advisors
- All materials must be pitch-ready and technically feasible
- Outcome: confirm whether Rātā is ready to seek funding and begin MVP development (Phase 2), whether it needs more, or whether it is not feasible

---

### 🎯 **Phase 1 Exit Criteria**

- All documents externally polished
- Pitch pack complete and reviewed
- Tech stack and dev plan validated
- Budget realistic and aligned to MVP goals
- Mentor and tech sign-off secured
- Clear go/no-go decision reached for Rātā’s execution

---

## 🚧 **Phase 2 – Conditional Kickoff: MVP Prototype Build** *(Pending Phase 1 Completion)*

> “Start building only once the vision and architecture are truly validated.”
> 

**🛠️ Value Unlocked (Future):** Demonstrates that Rātā’s core offline system functions reliably in field conditions and begins translating concept into code.

**🧭 Status:**

This phase is currently a placeholder. While core goals are known, the ability to begin Phase 2 depends on:

- Finalised tech architecture and stack from Phase 1
- Accurate cost estimates and validated timelines
- Confirmed team composition and hiring strategy
- External funding or development partnership confirmed

**Key Activities (Once Triggered):**

- Build core mobile app with GPS photo tagging and local sync
- Build static map dashboard with live visual updates
- Create backend structure to receive and display field data
- Run controlled offline tests using real terrain and mock data

---

## 🧪 **Phase 3 – Live Field Trials** *(Dependent on Phase 2 Results)*

> “Take the working prototype and test it where it matters—on the job.”
> 

**🛠️ Value Unlocked (Future):** Proof that Rātā saves time and improves workflows compared to legacy tools.

**🧭 Status:**

Phase 3 will not be scoped or scheduled until Phase 2 produces a stable MVP prototype. Timing and success criteria will be set based on real-world feasibility.

**Indicative Goals:**

- Deploy MVP in live contract work (via parent company or pilot partners)
- Observe usability: battery usage, sync performance, tagging friction
- Interview field users and document breakdowns or high points

---

## 🔁 **Phase 4 – Targeted Iteration & Expansion**

> “Now that it works—make it scale-ready.”
> 

**🛠️ Value Unlocked (Future):** Rātā becomes increasingly usable across larger teams and more complex operations.

**Potential Focus Areas:**

- Improve UX flows for tagging and entry
- Strengthen team-tracking overlays and map visibility
- Begin structuring backend data for future AI readiness
- Investigate tagging schemas for multi-species or complex jobs
- Lightly tailor for use in adjacent industries (e.g., biosecurity, ecological restoration)

---

## 🧽 **Phase 5 – Pre-Launch Stability & Readiness**

> “Pressure-test before it goes public.”
> 

**🛠️ Value Unlocked (Future):** Technical polish, operational readiness, and partner confidence.

**Conditioned on:**

- Full performance evaluation from prior phases
- Tech partner sign-off on backend and UI responsiveness
- MVP system holding stable across device types and terrains

---

## 🚀 **Phase 6 – Pilot Launch & Feedback Loop**

> “If it survives the wild, it’s real.”
> 

**🛠️ Value Unlocked (Future):** Real usage, real data, real decisions.

- Release under limited-use pilot agreements
- Create feedback loops with field crews, managers, and clients
- Begin onboarding support, training materials, and demo data creation
- Identify first scalable contract or region

---

## 💰 **Updated Funding & Growth Strategy**

### 🧭 Clarity Post-Phase 1

- All budget projections and fundraising efforts are **deferred until tech architecture and hiring plan are finalised**
- We do not yet know:
    - Final developer stack cost
    - Required team size for Phase 2–3 delivery
    - Timeline certainty

### 🪙 Early Signal to Funders (Post-Phase 1)

If Phase 1 delivers validated architecture and a complete pitch pack:

- Begin funding conversations with:
    - Callaghan Innovation
    - Angel investors
    - Pest control companies for co-builds
- Budget range remains **indicative only**: $150K–$250K

---

## 🌐 Strategic Partnerships (Deferred by Design)

The original vision for partnerships is still valid, but formal engagement is on hold until:

- MVP technical scope is confirmed
- Pilot implementation path is chosen (DOC, OSPRI, or private conservation partner)
- Sandbox API and data integrity protocols are ready

---

## 🛠️ From Tool → Platform (Long-Term Plan)

This sequence stays in place but is now explicitly phased:

1. **Validate the Tool** – via MVP field testing (Phases 2–3)
2. **Expand Capabilities** – only after successful pilot and feedback cycles (Phases 4–5)
3. **Open the Ecosystem** – integrations, APIs, and third-party support (Post-launch)
4. **Scale and Export** – target private conservation projects, then expand internationally into similar field operations markets (e.g., Australia, Canada, U.S. West)
