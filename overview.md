# Rātā – Executive Overview

Rātā is a real-time, geospatial pest control software platform designed for the unique conditions of Aotearoa’s rural conservation landscape. It combines the intuitive feel of consumer mobile apps like Snapchat with the power of GIS tools and game-engine mapping to deliver a system that streamlines how field teams collect data, manage traps, and make decisions.

Built from real-world experience in frontline pest control work, Rātā isn’t just another field app—it’s a ground-up reimagining of how data, people, and terrain come together to fight back against invasive species like possums, wallabies, and mustelids.

### What Makes Rātā Different?

- **Operator-first design**: The mobile app works like tools field teams already use daily, requiring minimal training.
- **Real-time command overview**: A high-performance game-engine dashboard (inspired by Google Earth) lets planners and managers view everything—from trap effectiveness to team movement—on a live map.
- **Offline-first**: Built for rugged areas with no signal, syncs when connectivity returns.
- **AI-ready**: Future integration of species detection, hotspot prediction, and barcode scanning tools.

### Why Now?

New Zealand’s Predator Free 2050 goals have catalysed a nationwide push for innovation, but tech that truly empowers on-the-ground operators is missing. Rātā fills this gap by making pest control smarter, faster, and more efficient—without adding complexity for those doing the work.

### Vision

To become the default platform for field-based pest operations in New Zealand—then export our AI-enabled pest control ecosystem to the world.
