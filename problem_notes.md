# Assignment Note – Problem & Opportunity

Purpose: Describe what sucks right now in pest control, and why it matters.

Focus Points:
- What are the key inefficiencies in field operations today?
- How are data collection, reporting, or coordination broken?
- Real examples from your own work: what frustrates operators?
- What’s the scale of the issue (NZ-wide, contract-wide)?
- Why has this problem not been solved well yet?

Tips:
- Be specific but clear enough for outsiders to understand
- Use bullet points if needed
